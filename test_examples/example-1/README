This example is of a 33-atoms small moluecule. The small molecule system is 
prepared and simulated using Amber MD simulation package.

This directory must also have following two files:
  1. The structure file
     * 0O.lig.gas.leap.prmtop
  2. A trajectory file, which contains 1000 frames.
     * 0O.lig-s500.nc 
Before being able to use CENTRE tools for computing configurational
entropy using MIE/MIST or A-MIE/A-MIST methods, this trajectory has
to be converted to a BAT trajectory for this we will use
cart2bat.py script packages with `pycentre` python package
all the possible arguments and their purpose can be found by running

cart2bat.py --help

One can use the cart2bat.inp file containing list of argument and 
associated values. To start the trajectory conversion use:

cart2bat.py @cart2bat.inp > cart2bat.out 2> cart2bat.err

NOTE: Notice cart2bat.inp is prefixed with '@' character to indicate that
parameters are to be read from file by script cart2bat.py.

After successfull completion of the run following files will be created.
	* 0O.lig-s500_dfs_11-8-7_bat.nc
	* info_inr_dfs_11-8-7.info
	* neigh_inr_dfs_11-8-7_6.txt
	* output_inr_dfs_11-8-7.log
	* subset_inr_dfs_11-8-7.txt
	* tree_inr_dfs_11-8-7.txt

Now let us make a directory and copy/move relevant files to it for entropy
computation using centre. Let us also make a direcory for centre output 
files created during the run.In case directories are missing.

mkdir -p inpfiles outfiles-h outfiles-v

mv 0O.lig-s500_dfs_11-8-7_bat.nc tree_inr_dfs_11-8-7.txt \
   subset_inr_dfs_11-8-7.txt neigh_inr_dfs_11-8-7_*.txt inpfiles/

Now lets change directory to inpfiles, and get the absolute paths for
inpfiles and outfiles-h. Copy these paths to centre-histogram-inp.cfg file 
before running centre.

There are two different build options, one creates a OpenMP parallel
executable which utilized the thread based parallelism the executable
will be:
centre_OMP

second is MPI+OMP hybrid build, the executable will be:
centre_OMPMPI

Lets assume  we want to use 2 threads for computations using centre_OMP 
then we need to do as below:

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
/path/to/centre/bin/centre_OMP -i centre-histogram-inp.cfg > centre-h-run.out \
2> centre-h-run.err &

After completion of successfull run the entropy convergance will be reported 
in MIE*.csv MIST*.csv if MIST method is chosen otherwise only MIE*.csv. All the 
values reported are unitless to convert to kcal/mol or kJ/mol, R*T i.e.
Gas_Constant*Tempeteture in appropriate units has to multiplied to the values 
in report file.
